# Core JavaScript & Language Features.

1. Explain the JavaScript event loop and microtasks vs. macrotasks.

 # event loop

 Event Loop Flow (Simplified)

 > JS code starts executing → functions are added to the call stack.
 > Async functions (e.g., setTimeout, fetch) are sent to the Web APIs.
 > When async ops are done:

   - Their callbacks go to the task queue.

   - Promise.then() callbacks go to the microtask queue.
> The event loop:

If the call stack is empty:

- Runs all microtasks in order.

- Then runs one task from the task queue.

Repeats.

> Call Stack
- A stack that keeps track of the functions being called and executed.

> Web APIs (Browser APIs)
- Provided by the browser (or Node.js in a server environment) to handle asynchronous operations —    like setTimeout, fetch, or DOM events.

> Callback Queue (Task Queue)
- Holds the callbacks from Web APIs after they finish — waiting to be pushed to the call stack.

> Microtask Queue
- Holds promises, queueMicrotask, and MutationObserver callbacks. These are processed before the task queue in each loop cycle.

> Event Loop
- Continuously checks the call stack. If the stack is empty, it pushes the next task (from microtask queue first, then task queue) into the stack to run.
